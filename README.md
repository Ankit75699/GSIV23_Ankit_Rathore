## Challenges

```bash
1. Movie Cards on List Page:- Display upcoming movies in a visually appealing manner using movie cards.
   why:- Demonstrates my proficiency in UI design and data presentation.

2. Pagination for List Page:- implement pagination to ensure smooth loading and browsing of movie listings.
   why:- This showcases my ability to manage large data sets and provide a seamless user experience.

3. Search Functionality:

   a) Enable users to search for movies using a search API.
   b) Display search results on the List page itself.
   c) When search is canceled, revert to showing all movies again.
   why:- Demonstrates my skills in integrating APIs, handling user input, and dynamic data manipulation.

4. Responsive Design:- Design the app's pages to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
   why:- Highlights my capability to create a user-friendly interface across various devices and screen sizes.

6. State Management and Routing Libraries:- Utilizing a state management library like react-redux to efficiently manage and update application state.

## Issues Faced during developement
```bash
1) The upcoming API includes responses for movies released on previous dates as well. However, it does not provide data necessary for sorting the movies by the latest releases first. So sorting not performed in the app for latest release.

2) The search API does not include information about the directors and cast of the movies within the response object. As a result, I have implemented a workaround by manually specifying the cast as "Actors1" and "Actors2".
```

## Solution
```bash
If I had 4 hours more I will integrate the typescript in the app by adding using typescript library
```
